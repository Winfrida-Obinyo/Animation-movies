MOVIE ANIMATION SEARCH APPLICATION SITE

EXPECTATION
The search application will be required to display animation movies for the kids. It will refine the kids from accessing any other content apart from the cartoon network.


The interface will have an animated transition from the background since its a one page design
the work of the javascript code will be to :


1. getMovies() — A function to fetch movies from API and returns the results using fetch function.The results will be passed to showMovies() function.

2. displayMovies() — A function to showcase the results in the browser which basically inserts the HTML code dynamically.The data to this function is passed from the getMovies() function.

3. getClassByRate() — A function which returns the color based on movie rating obtained from API. This color is used in CSS to choose the color of the movie rating text.

4. An EventListener for search of movies.Once you enter the movie name in the search bar and by clicking on enter will actually submit the form and this event listerner will be triggered.The movie matching the name entered in the search bar will be fetched from the API and it will automatically display all the related title on the list.
